# Shopping-List-App
This is a shopping list built to be as simple as possible but also as useful as possible. This is an app focused on providing an user friendly experience.

## Concept
The concept is simple. An app that can be used by anyone and it is extremely easy to use. There is no Login screen or any information
related with the user. It is just a simple shopping list.

## One Screen App
The app was created to be used only on one screen. The user wont need to change screen or wait for any loading screen since the memory
used to save the items on the list is local. The app was design using AlertDialog. It makes the UX much easier to deal and user friendly.

### Standard/Inital Screen
As you can see below, the standard screen is pretty intuitive and easy to use.
